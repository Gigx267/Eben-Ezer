                        <span class="text-primary">Chaplaincy Program</span>
                    </h1>
                    <p class="mb-4">As a faith-based, not-for-profit care community, Eben Ezer seeks to provide comprehensive care for our residents, who we call neighbors. Our care philosophy addresses the “whole” person as a composite of physical, emotional and spiritual needs and includes the voice of the neighbor in their own care. The spiritual health and needs of the neighbors play a key role in their overall enjoyment of their lives as they age.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The Eben Ezer founder, Pastor Jens Madsen, recognized the connection between health and spirit. In the early years Lutheran Deaconesses served in multiple care-giving and ministry roles. Throughout the years spiritual care has been an important part of the person-directed care ministry at Eben Ezer.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Today, Eben Ezer offers the services of a Chaplaincy program, as a valued part of the care team. Currently, a Chaplain serves part-time on-site during the week. The part-time chaplain, serves to meet the spiritual and emotional needs of our neighbors through personal one on one visits as well as group activities, Bible study, song-fests, Faith Talk, group devotionals and other activities.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Upon admission to Eben Ezer, each resident is visited by our chaplain and given a spiritual assessment. Covered with the new neighbor during the initial assessment are:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>The chaplain will make initial contact with a new neighbor.</li>
                        <li>The chaplain will inform the neighbor of chaplaincy availability and scheduled spiritual programs at Eben Ezer, including worship opportunities at All Saints Church and in the individual neighborhoods. Channel 39 serves as an in-room participation avenue for any neighbor unable to go to the Church. The Chaplain will be sure the neighbor is able to tune into the TV Channel 39, and check the station exists on the neighbor’s channel list.</li>
                        <li>The chaplain will produce a spiritual care plan to be housed in the electronic medical record.</li>
                        <li>The chaplain will contact the neighbor’s faith community as per the neighbor’s request, to inform the community of the neighbor’s presence at Eben Ezer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">Neighbors are invited to participate in our many opportunities for worship and study. There are scheduled programs offered every day of the week, except Saturday, to include: small group Bible study, sing a-longs, devotions at regular meetings, end-of-life support, and other activities.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The chaplain offers individualized support for our neighbors, their families, and our team. Area pastors are encouraged to provide pastoral/spiritual care for their members living at Eben Ezer, as well. Besides the variety of services and studies, the chaplain makes hospital visits, and tends to the spiritual/emotional needs of the neighbor and their family during times of health crisis and/or death.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Our chaplain is also available to preside over funerals, memorials, and weddings that are conducted in the historic All Saint’s Lutheran Church, located on our grounds, as well as other locations in our Morgan County community.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Guide Posts devotionals, Christ in Our Home devotionals, weekly Sunday worship bulletins and Holy Bibles are available by request. Prayers are always available and spoken often.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">All Saints Church was dedicated September 15, 1918. The building was designed by Eben Ezer founder, Rev. Jens Madsen, and built by mostly volunteer workers. Madsen wanted the sanctuary to reflect the presence of the sacred with a sense of intimacy. He sought to do this with beautiful stained glass, gothic arches, a pitched beam wood ceiling, oak pews, and limited seating.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The name “All Saints” was chosen to reflect the church as a place of worship for all believers. It was to be an open door of spiritual nourishment to all the residents of Eben Ezer. All Saints Church, as “house of prayer” was to symbolize the central place of the Gospel in the work and ministry of Eben Ezer. All Saints Church provides the residents of Eben Ezer with an opportunity to enrich and deepen their spirituality.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">All Saints was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior in June, 1982.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Each neighbor is invited to participate in our many opportunities for worship and study. Scheduled programs are offered throughout the week, which include:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>Sunday Worship – 9:45 a.m. in the All Saint’s Lutheran Church. Communion services are generally available every service.</li>
                        <li>Bible Study – Fridays at Dahms Talton and Arbor Assisted Living</li>
                        <li>Faith Talks – weekly in Deaconess, Elim and Madsen neighborhoods</li>
